    {
      "question": "What is the role of breast MRI in breast cancer detection?",
      "answer": "Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a diagnostic tool that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the breast tissue. It is often used in addition to mammography and ultrasound for high-risk individuals or to evaluate the extent of breast cancer in newly diagnosed patients."

    {
      "question": "What are clinical trials and their importance in breast cancer research?",
      "answer": "Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments, drugs, or interventions for breast cancer to determine their safety and effectiveness. Participation in clinical trials can provide patients access to cutting-edge treatments and contribute to advancements in breast cancer care."
